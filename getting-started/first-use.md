# First Use Setup

WolvenKit is the Witcher 3 Modding Community's mod editor. This means, it is a unified program to view and edit all the game's assets, e.g. the textures, models (w2mesh) and all the other game's files like entity files, behaviorgraphs, quest files etc etc.

**Quick Start:** Using WolvenKit should be easy and intuitive: All starts with creating a new **Mod Project**. Once you did this, you can use WolvenKit to browse the game's assets or create your own. Use the [**Asset Browser**](../wolvenkit-app/asset-browser.md) to browse the game files. To add a game file to your mod, click "Add to Mod". If you did your changes to the file, click **Pack Mod** (in the toolbar or the menu).

## First Launch

WolvenKit will ask you for two things on first launch: (WolvenKit will try to automatically fetch this information based on your steam/gog install) 1. The location of the Witcher 3 Game. 2. The location of the Witcher 3 Modkit: If you don't already have the Modkit installed, you need to download it here: [https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/3173](https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/3173)

The location of the uncooked files depot is set automatically to the r4depot of wcc\_lite.

> Make sure you have no spaces in the path to the Modkit! WolvenKit will warn you in any case, but is best to install the Modkit in a location like e.g. D:\MODDING\Modkit.

There are some more setting found here:

* Color Theme: Chose from 3 themes: Dark, Light and Blue
* Uncooked Extension: Specify the image type when uncooking (exporting) textures from the game. Default is tga.
* Disable Welcome Form: disables the welcome form surprisingly.

> The first launch of WolvenKit may take some time (up to around 15minutes) indexing the game's files. Subsequent launches are very fast (around 1 minute).
