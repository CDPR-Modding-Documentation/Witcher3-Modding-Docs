# Creating a Witcher 3 Mod Project

After the paths have been correctly specified, you are greeted with the Welcome Form.

![WolvenKit Welcome](https://github.com/Traderain/Wolven-kit/wiki/assets/0.7\_welcome.jpg)

In order to use WolvenKit's functions and tools you need to have a **Mod Project**. Create a new Mod Project or open an existing mod project from the welcome form.

> A WolvenKit mod project consists of a .w3modproj file and many folders, so it is advisable to create a new folder and save your WolvenKit project inside the new folder. Once you have created a new project, you can use WolvenKit to browse the game's assets or create your own.

On the welcome form you find

* buttons to create and open existing mod projects
* a shortcut to opening the Preferences menu again
* your recent project files
* useful links to this wiki and tutorials
