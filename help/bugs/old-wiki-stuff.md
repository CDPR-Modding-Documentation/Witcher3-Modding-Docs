# Old Wiki stuff

* Delete the files inside /ManagerCache/
*   And all the xml files inside wolvenkti's root folder

    **System.IO.IOException: Access to the path '' is denied. etc.**
* Run WolvenKit as administractor. When WolvenKit tries to access the path of wcc\_lite etc. if its on c/program files or such it needs administrator privileges. If you don't want to do that. Place everything on a place where system privilege is not needed.
