# Editor Interface

Once you created a new mod project, this is the main Wolvenkit Window from which everything is done.

## Folder Structure

You can already see the structure of a Witcher 3 Mod Project to the left:

> More information is found here: **The Witcher 3 Modding Workflow \<missing link>** 1. DLC: Files placed here will be made into a **dlc**, that is custom additional content which does not directly modify any vanilla game assets. 2. MOD: Files placed here will be made into a **mod** mod, that is a custom modification of vanilla game assets. 3. RAW: This is a directory of all **raw** assets (pictures, meshes, apb files) See [here](../guides/github-guides/project-structure/) for an explanation of what counts as a raw asset. 4. Radish: This directory is used for Wolvenkit-Radish Modding tools integration: See Full Guide: **Radish Integration in WolvenKit \<missing link>**

## Menus

In the menus you will find important tools, settings and utilities for modding The Witcher 3.
